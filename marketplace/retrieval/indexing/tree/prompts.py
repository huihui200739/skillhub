## Goal
Each output group MUST contain leaf categories that are functionally equivalent for query retrieval.
If one leaf category in the group can solve a query, the other leaf categories in the same
group should generally solve it too.

## Rules
1. Reuse only provided leaf IDs. Do not invent new leaf IDs.
2. Partition all leaf IDs into 1-{max_groups} groups.
3. Prefer fewer, high-purity groups over many fragmented groups.

1. Group by user intent, not technical functionality

## Skills to Evaluate
{skills_list}

## Your Task
Select skills by mapping out the COMPLETE WORKFLOW to achieve the goal.

## Step 1: Decompose into Workflow Stages

Think through what's needed at each stage:

### UPSTREAM (0-2 skills) - Gather & Prepare
What input/content needs to be accessed or extracted first?
- Reading documents, extracting data, gathering source material
- Ask: "What does the user need to START with?"

### PRODUCTION (1-5 skills) - Create & Build
What tangible deliverables or assets need to be CREATED?
- Think BROADLY: visuals, documents, presentations, websites, videos
- Ask: "What would the user SHOW, SHARE, or USE?"
- Ask: "What would a professional create for this task?"
- IMPORTANT: Different formats serve different purposes - a presentation is not a substitute for an image

### DOWNSTREAM (0-2 skills) - Deliver & Distribute
How will the created content reach its audience?
- Publishing, sharing, deploying, distributing

## Critical Thinking Prompts
Before selecting skills, ask yourself:
1. "What FORMATS could help achieve this goal?" (visual/document/web/social)
2. "What would make this goal SUCCESSFUL, not just done?"
3. "Am I selecting skills that CREATE things, or just skills that SOUND related?"

## Anti-Pattern Warning
Do NOT over-index on keyword-matching skills:
- "promote" ≠ only marketing/SEO skills
- Effective promotion requires ASSETS to promote
- Creation tools often matter MORE than distribution tools

1. **Deduplicate**: If multiple skills have overlapping functionality, keep only the BEST one
2. **Keep generously**: Retain skills that could potentially help with ANY aspect of the task
